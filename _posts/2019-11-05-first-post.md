Finally comfortable with the theme and Jekyll to start playing with the menu structure to add a new documentation "product" about [doom.is](/); I'll be documenting the documenting along the way, and the workflow should be conducive to load sharing documentation out using git to merge revisions and new docs from other authors that may want to contribute.

Using [Atom](https://atom.io) as the editor and git-client seems to be a streamlined process so far.  Impressed!

Back-posting a little stub post for the day the site came up, yesterday as well.  So this is the second first post, or the first second post? hmm...
