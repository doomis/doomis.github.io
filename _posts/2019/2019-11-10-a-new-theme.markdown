The past few days have been spent learning and configuring a new theme.  [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) is a highly configurable responsive theme with a modern look and multiple color palette choices.  The theme also comes with a diverse set of page layouts, good navigation design, and is being actively developed.

Unfortunately these mechanical background choices eat a lot of time up front.  Once they are set and settled a better workflow should start to emerge, and more productive activities brought to the forefront.

At this stage, I'm fairly happy with the knowledgebase breakdown into three distinct categories.  **Basic** should encompass quick, straightforward articles designed to get a new user up to speed and *using* stuff as quickly as possible.  Some minutia may be ok, but probably should be split out into "asides" or branched feature documentation.  **Build** should contain a detailed breakdown of resilient and decentralized systems we've explored and put to use, with the idea being a new, motivated volunteer can get integrated into the infrastructure safely, knowledgeably, and with clear steps of progression.  **Write** should document this and other documentation projects; applied technical writing to resilience and collapse-aware projects.  A focus on the tool set and infrastructure used to publish should be up front, followed by thoughts on audience concerns, style guides, etc.
