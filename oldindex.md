## Check News

Each major commit/update will have a News post to keep everyone up-to-date, check the [News](news.html) page for more details.  There is an RSS feed generated for that page as well, it should sync with the ten most recent updates if you use a feed reader.

### 1. Documenting Doom.is

The plan is to document procedures and processes as I go along.  Normally I take notes for myself and had been doing so for demoing various P2P and decentralized communications networks and software; in order to prevent duplication of effort I decided to bring up this documentation website to keep track of progress.  The unfortunate side effect is now the added workload of documenting the documentation tools and processes; but with any luck there will be future dividends with a community workflow.
